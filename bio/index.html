<p>
<a href="http://www.debevec.org/"><b>Paul Debevec</b></a> is the Director of Research, Creative Algorithms and Technology at <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> and Adjunct Research Professor of <a href="http://www.cs.usc.edu/">Computer Science</a> in the <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/">Viterbi School of Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>, working within the <a href="http://vgl.ict.usc.edu/">Vision and Graphics Laboratory</a> at the <a href="http://www.ict.usc.edu/">USC Institute for Creative Technologies</a>.
</p>

<p>
Debevec's computer graphics research has been recognized with ACM SIGGRAPH's first <a href="award.html">Significant New Researcher Award</a> in 2001 for "Creative
and Innovative Work in the Field of Image-Based Modeling and Rendering", a Scientific and Engineering <a href="http://viterbi.usc.edu/news/news/2010/academy-award-to.htm">Academy Awardï¿½</a> in 2010 for "the design and engineering of the <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/LightStages/">Light Stage</a> capture devices and the image-based facial rendering system developed for character relighting in motion pictures" with Tim Hawkins, John Monos, and Mark Sagar, and the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/paul-debevec-be-honored-by-motion-picture-tv-engineers-1031488">SMPTE Progress Medal</a> in 2017 in recognition of his achievements and ongoing work in pioneering techniques for illuminating computer-generated objects based on measurement of real-world illumination and their effective commercial application in numerous Hollywood films.  In 2014, he was profiled in <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/28/pixel-perfect-2">"Pixel Perfect: The Scientist Behind the Digital Cloning of Actors"
</a> article by Margaret Talbot and worked with the <a href="http://www.si.edu/">Smithsonian Institution</a> to scan a <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/PresidentialPortrait/">3D model of President Barack Obama</a> at The White House.
</p>

<p>
Debevec earned degrees in Math and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1992 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 1996.  In 1991, he combined techniques from computer vision and computer graphics to create an image-based model of a <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Chevette/"><i><b>Chevette</b></i></a> automobile from photographs.  At 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_Research_Corporation">Interval Research Corporation</a> he contributed to Michael Naimark's <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Immersion/">
<i><b>Immersion '94</b></i></a> virtual exploration of Banff National forest and collaborated with <a href="http://www.flong.com/">Golan Levin</a> on the interactive art installation 
<a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/golan/rouen/"><i><b>Rouen Revisited</b></i></a>.
</p>

<p>
Debevec's 1996 <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Thesis/">Ph.D. thesis</a> with Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~malik/">Jitendra Malik</a> presented <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Research/"><i><b>Fa&#231ade</b></i></a>, an image-based modeling system for creating virtual cinematography of architectural scenes using new techniques for photogrammetry and image-based rendering.  Using Fa&#231ade he directed a photorealistic fly-around of the Berkeley campus for his 1997 film <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Campanile/"><i><b>The Campanile Movie</b></i></a> whose techniques were later used to create the Academy Award-winning virtual backgrounds in the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_time">bullet time</a>" shots in the 1999 film <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Campanile/#matrix"><i><b>The Matrix</b></i></a>.
</p>

<p>
Following his Ph.D, Debevec pioneered techniques for <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Research/IBL/">illuminating computer-generated objects</a> with measurements of <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Probes/">real-world illumination</a>.  His 1999 film <a href="http://www.debevec.org/FiatLux/"><i><b>Fiat Lux</b></i></a> rendered towering monoliths and gleaming spheres into a photorealistic reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica, realistically illuminated by the light that was actually there.  Techniques from this research known as HDRI and Image-Based Lighting have been used to dramatic effect in films such as the <i><b>The Matrix</b></i> sequels, <i><b>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</b></i>, <i><b>Terminator: Salvation</b></i>, <i><b>District 9</b></i>, and <i><b>Avatar</b></i>.  Debevec led the design of <a href="http://www.hdrshop.com/">HDR Shop</a>, an high dynamic range image editing program for visual effects production, and co-authored the 2005 book <a href="http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780123749147"><i><b>High Dynamic Range Imaging</b></i></a>, now in its second edition.
</p>

<p>
Debevec's 2004 computer animation <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Films/Parthenon/"><i><b>The Parthenon</b></i></a> used 3D scanning, inverse global illumination, HDRI, and image-based lighting to virtually reunite the Parthenon and its sculptures, contributing to depictions of the Parthenon's history for the <a href="http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&folder=415&article=11541">2004 Olympics</a>, NHK televison, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/parthenon/">PBS's NOVA</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/treasure-wars/parthenon-marbles.html">National Geographic</a>, the IMAX film <a href="http://www.greecefilm.com/behind.htm#CGI"><i><b>Greece: Secrets of the Past</b></i></a>, and <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/">The Louvre</a>.
</p>

<p>
At USC ICT Debevec has led the development of several <a href="http://www.debevec.org/Research/LS/"><i><b>Light Stage</b></i></a> systems that capture and simulate how people and
objects appear under real-world illumination.  Early Light Stage processes have been used by Sony Pictures Imageworks, WETA Digital, and Digital Domain to create photoreal digital actors in award-winning visual effects in <i><b><a href="http://www.imageworks.com/films/spiderman2/stokdyk.html">Spider-Man 2</a></b></i> and <i><b>King Kong</b></i>, <i><b><a
href="http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=3644">Superman Returns</a></b></i>, <i><b>Spider-Man 3</b></i>, <i><b>Hancock</b></i>, and the <i><b>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</b></i>.  The most recent light stage process based on <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/FaceScanning/">polarized gradient illumination</a> has been used in numerous films including James Cameron's <i><b>Avatar</b></i>, <i><b>The Avengers</b></i>, <i><b>Oblivion</b></i>, <i><b>Ender's Game</b></i>, <i><b>Gravity</b></i>, and <i><b>Maleficent</b></i>.  This high resolution facial scanning process was used in 2008's <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/DigitalEmily/">Digital Emily</a> project, a collaboration with <a href="http://www.image-metrics.com/">Image Metrics</a> which produced one of the first digital facial performances to cross the "<a href="http://www.awn.com/articles/technology/digital-eye-image-metrics-attempts-leap-uncanny-valley">Uncanny Valley</a>", and <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/DigitalIra/"><b><i>Digital Ira</i></b></a>, a collaboration with <a href="http://www.activision.com/">Activision</a> which has produced one of the earliest photoreal real-time digital characters.
</p>

<p>
Collaborating with virtual reality pioneer <a href="http://ict.usc.edu/profile/mark-bolas/">Mark Bolas</a>, Debevec has developed glasses-free 3D displays involving <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/3DDisplay/">spinning display surfaces</a> and <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/PicoArray/">video projector arrays</a> for applications such as <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/3DTeleconferencing/">3D Teleconferencing</a> and, in collaboration with <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/shoah-foundation/">USC's Shoah Foundation</a>, preserving the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/holograms-of-holocaust-survivors-let-crucial-stories-live-on/">testimony of survivors of the Holocaust</a>.
</p>

<p>
In 2002 Debevec was named one of the world's <a href="http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?trid=248">top 100 young innovators</a> by MIT's Technology Review magazine, and in 2005 received a <a href="http://www.nae.edu/nae/naehome.nsf/weblinks/CGOZ-67XQED">Gilbreth Lectureship</a> from the <a href="http://www.nae.edu/">National Academy of Engineering</a>.  In 2005 Debevec received the Special Award for a Distinguished Professional Career in Animation/VFX from the <a href="www.mundodigitales.org">Mundos Digitales</a> Festival in A Coruna, Spain and in 2009 received the "Visionary Award for VFX" at the 3rd Annual <a href="http://www.theelans.com/">Awards for the Electronic and Animated Arts</a>.
